# course-notes
Shows notes i've made on my journey to `machine_learning_with_tensorflow_on_gcp_specialization`

If these notes help 1 person, i'll be happy! This is my attempt to give back to the open source community

Apologies if my earlier course notes aren't well laid out, I improved my note taking as I went on this journey. My favourite courses were [008_ml_ops](./008_ml_ops) & [009_ml_pipelines_on_gcp](./009_ml_pipelines_on_gcp).
