### Predicting Visitor Purchases with a Classification Model with BigQuery ML

Lab found [here](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1794?parent=catalog)

**Select your performance criteria**

For classification problems in ML, you want to minimize the False Positive Rate (predict that the user will return and purchase and they don't) and maximize the True Positive Rate (predict that the user will return and purchase and they do).

This relationship is visualized with a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve like the one shown here, where you try to maximize the area under the curve or AUC:

**Improve model performance with feature engineering**
<img src="./pictures/roc_great.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

Results:
- Of the top 6% of first-time visitors (sorted in decreasing order of predictedprobability)more than 6% make a purchase in a later visit.
- These users represent nearly 50% of all first-time visitors who make a purchase in alater visit.
- Overall, only 0.7% of first-time visitors make a purchase in a later visit.
- Targeting the top 6% of first-time increases marketing ROI by 9x vs targeting them all!


`roc_auc` is just one of the performance metrics available during model evaluation. Also available are accuracy, precision, and recall. Knowing which performance metric to rely on is highly dependent on what your overall objective or goal is.

Precision and Recall Overview ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall))

<img src="./pictures/precision_recall.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

Though our linear classification (logistic regression) model performed well after feature engineering, it may be too simple of a model to fully capture the relationship between the features and the label. Using the same dataset and labels as you did in Task 6 to create the model ecommerce.classification_model_2, your challenge is to create a XGBoost Classifier.
```
 Hint : Use following options for Boosted_Tree_Classifier:
1. L2_reg = 0.1
2. num_parallel_tree = 8
3. max_tree_depth = 10
```

```

Model Evaluation SQL 

**By using a Boosted tree classifier model, you can observe a slight improvement of 0.2 in our ROC AUC compared to the previous model. By comparing the result above with the previous model shown in Task 7, you can see the confidence the model has in its predictions is more accurate when compared to the logistic_regression model type.**

### Creating a Streaming Data Pipeline for a Real-Time Dashboard with Dataflow

Lab found [here](https://googlecoursera.qwiklabs.com/focuses/17558103?parent=lti_session) (link may not work, not sure why)

1. **Pub/Sub Topic to BigQuery**

- Input Pub/Sub topic, enter `projects/pubsub-public-data/topics/taxirides-realtime`
- BQ Schema created here:
```
bq mk taxirides
```
```
bq mk \
--time_partitioning_field timestamp \
--schema ride_id:string,point_idx:integer,latitude:float,longitude:float,\
timestamp:timestamp,meter_reading:float,meter_increment:float,ride_status:string,\
passenger_count:integer -t taxirides.realtime
```
- BigQuery output table, enter `<myprojectid>:taxirides.realtime`
- Under Temporary location, enter `gs://<mybucket>/tmp/`

2. **DataStudio Tip**  `datastudio.google.com`

- Using `row_number` to use as a `dashboard_sort`
```
SELECT
 ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS dashboard_sort,
 minute,
```
Example:
- Chart type: Combo chart
- Date range Dimension: dashboard_sort
- Dimension: dashboard_sort
- **Drill Down: dashboard_sort (Make sure that Drill down option is turned ON)**
- Metric: SUM() total_rides, SUM() total_passengers, SUM() total_revenue
- Sort: dashboard_sort, Ascending (latest rides first)
