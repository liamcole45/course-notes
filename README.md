# course-notes
Shows notes i've made on my journey to `machine_learning_with_tensorflow_on_gcp_specialization`

If these notes help 1 person, i'll be happy

Each course I felt I was more effective at making notes/documenting, so apologies if earlier course notes aren't well laid out

This is my attempt to give back the open source community
